# Tellus Design Improvement Ideas

This document tracks design improvement ideas discovered during documentation development and testing. These are not immediate action items, but considerations for future development.

## API Design & Imports

### Current Issues
- **Inconsistent Export Pattern**: `LocationKind` is not exported at the package level, requiring users to import from internal modules
- **Import Complexity**: Users need to know internal module structure to access common enums and utilities
- **Location Creation Pattern**: Current workflow of load/check-if-exists/create-new is awkward and error-prone
- **Location.fs Path Resolution Bug**: `location.fs` operates in current working directory instead of the location's configured path - this breaks the location abstraction entirely. Local locations should be sandboxed to their configured path regardless of where Python is executed from.

### Improvement Ideas
- **Flatten Common Imports**: Export commonly used items like `LocationKind`, `LocationContext`, and progress utilities at the package level
- **Consistent API Surface**: Establish clear rules for what gets exported in `__init__.py` vs. requiring deep imports
- **Import Guidance**: Consider adding an `all` submodule that re-exports everything for power users
- **Cleaner Location Management**: Improve the existing/new Location handling pattern

```python
# Proposed improved imports
from tellus import Location, Simulation, LocationKind, LocationContext
# vs current
from tellus import Location, Simulation
from tellus.location.location import LocationKind
from tellus.simulation.context import LocationContext

# Proposed improved Location management
location = Location.get_or_create("my-hpc-cluster", config=hpc_config)
# vs current awkward pattern
try:
    location = Location.load("my-hpc-cluster")
except FileNotFoundError:
    location = Location.from_dict({...})
    location.save()

# Alternative: Factory pattern with clear semantics
location = Location.ensure("my-hpc-cluster", config=hpc_config)  # Create if missing
location = Location.load_or_fail("my-hpc-cluster")             # Fail if missing  
location = Location.load_or_default("my-hpc-cluster", default_config)  # Use default if missing
```

## Documentation Integration

### Current Observations
- **CLI vs. Python API Gap**: CLI documentation exists, but programmatic API usage patterns need more examples
- **Real-world Workflow Examples**: Current docs focus on individual components, could use more end-to-end workflow examples

### Improvement Ideas
- **Auto-generated API Docs**: Use sphinx-autodoc to ensure API documentation stays in sync
- **Interactive Examples**: More Jupyter notebook examples showing realistic workflows
- **CLI-Python Bridge**: Show how CLI operations map to programmatic API calls

## User Experience

### Current Observations from Documentation Testing
- **Import Discovery**: New users may struggle to find the right import paths
- **Configuration Complexity**: Location setup requires understanding of storage backend details

### Improvement Ideas
- **Import Helper**: Consider a `tellus.shortcuts` or `tellus.api` module with commonly used imports
- **Configuration Wizard**: Programmatic equivalent of CLI wizards for common setup tasks
- **Error Messages**: Improve import errors to suggest correct import paths

## Architecture Considerations

### Current Strengths
- **Clean separation**: Domain/Application/Infrastructure layers are well-defined
- **Modular design**: Components can be used independently
- **Extensible**: Storage backends and workflows can be extended

### Potential Improvements
- **Plugin Discovery**: Automatic discovery of custom storage backends or workflow templates
- **Configuration Schema**: JSON/YAML schema validation for configuration files
- **Type Hints**: More comprehensive type annotations for better IDE support

## Performance & Scalability

### Areas for Future Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Import time optimization by lazy-loading heavy dependencies
- **Concurrent Operations**: Better support for parallel file operations
- **Memory Management**: Streaming support for very large datasets

## Developer Experience

### Build & Test Improvements
- **Example Testing**: Automated testing of documentation examples in CI
- **API Stability**: Version compatibility testing for API changes
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Track performance regressions in core operations

### Development Tools
- **Debug Mode**: Enhanced logging/debugging for development
- **Profiling Integration**: Built-in performance profiling tools
- **Migration Tools**: Helper scripts for major version upgrades

## Climate Science Domain

### Scientific Workflow Integration
- **Metadata Standards**: Better CF-compliance checking and validation
- **Data Provenance**: Tracking of data transformations and lineage
- **Reproducibility**: Better support for reproducible research workflows

### Earth Science Ecosystem
- **Intake Integration**: Seamless integration with intake catalogs
- **Xarray Optimization**: Performance optimization for xarray-based workflows
- **Cloud-native**: Better support for cloud-optimized formats (Zarr, Kerchunk)

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Service Architecture
- **Microservices**: Consider breaking into smaller, focused services
- **Event-driven**: Event sourcing for better auditability and debugging
- **API Versioning**: Strategy for backward compatibility as API evolves

### Deployment & Operations
- **Container Support**: Official Docker images and Kubernetes operators
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and observability
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple research groups on shared infrastructure

## Community & Ecosystem

### Contribution Improvements
- **Plugin Architecture**: Clearer interfaces for extending Tellus
- **Template Library**: Community-contributed workflow templates
- **Integration Examples**: More examples integrating with popular tools
