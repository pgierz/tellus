The following things need to be addressed immediately:
* [x] tellus simulation list command should not display a Path. Just number of locations, number of attributes, number of workflows, number of files
* [ ] tellus simulation location list lads to an error: SimulationDto has no attribute location contexts
* [ ] tellus simulation attrs has a different interface, why?
* [ ] tellus simulation files is just a stub?
